# Data-Science

## What is data science?
Data Science is all about using data to solve problems and help businesses make better decisions.
It means finding patterns, making predictions, and giving useful advice based on data.

### Steps 

- Understanding business problem
- Data Collction
- Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Build Model
- Collect Insight

#### Understand the Problem
First, know what the company or business wants to solve.
For example: “Why are our sales low?” or “Can we predict customer buying?”

#### Collect Data
Gather the information you need.
This can be from websites, company records, surveys, or apps.

#### Clean and Explore Data
Clean it: Fix mistakes, fill missing info, remove errors.
Explore it: Look at the data carefully — check patterns, numbers, or weird values.
This helps you understand the story hidden inside the data.

#### Build a Model (Make Predictions)
Use tools like machine learning to make a model that can learn from the data.
This model can then predict or classify things.
For example: Predict which customers may leave a service.

#### Find Insights and Share
After getting results, explain them in a simple way.
Use charts, reports, or presentations to help people understand what the data says and what action they should take.

## In One Line:
Data Science is the process of turning raw data into useful knowledge to solve real problems.

## Road map

#### Step 1: Learn Programming (Python or R)
Basics of Python: variables, loops, functions, data types

Learn libraries for data:

NumPy (numbers, arrays)

Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (data visualization)

#### Step 2: Learn SQL & Databases
How to store and query data

Basics of SQL commands (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN)

#### Step 3: Learn Statistics & Probability
Mean, Median, Mode

Probability basics

Correlation, Regression

Hypothesis Testing

#### Step 4: Learn Data Visualization
Visualizing data trends with charts and graphs

Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, or Tableau

#### Step 5: Master Machine Learning Basics
Understand Supervised & Unsupervised Learning

Learn algorithms like:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

K-Means Clustering

Random Forest

Use Scikit-Learn

#### Step 6: Work on Projects
Start with small datasets

Do simple tasks: Predict house prices, analyze customer data, etc.

Use Kaggle for practice

#### Step 7: Learn Data Storytelling & Communication
Learn how to explain your findings with visuals and simple language

#### Step 8 (Optional): Learn Deep Learning
Basics of Neural Networks

Use TensorFlow or PyTorch

Apply for image, text, or advanced predictions

#### Step 9: Learn Model Deployment
