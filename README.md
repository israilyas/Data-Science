## What is data science?
Data Science is all about using data to solve problems and help businesses make better decisions.
It means finding patterns, making predictions, and giving useful advice based on data.

### Steps 

- Understanding business problem
- Data Collction
- Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Build Model
- Collect Insight

#### Understand the Problem
First, know what the company or business wants to solve.
For example: “Why are our sales low?” or “Can we predict customer buying?”

#### Collect Data
Gather the information you need.
This can be from websites, company records, surveys, or apps.

#### Clean and Explore Data
Clean it: Fix mistakes, fill missing info, remove errors.
Explore it: Look at the data carefully — check patterns, numbers, or weird values.
This helps you understand the story hidden inside the data.

#### Build a Model (Make Predictions)
Use tools like machine learning to make a model that can learn from the data.
This model can then predict or classify things.
For example: Predict which customers may leave a service.

#### Find Insights and Share
After getting results, explain them in a simple way.
Use charts, reports, or presentations to help people understand what the data says and what action they should take.

## In One Line:
Data Science is the process of turning raw data into useful knowledge to solve real problems.
